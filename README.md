# WiZ Light Frequency Audio Visualizer Installer

This repository contains a program that provides dynamic control and visualization of WiZ lights using audio frequencies. It combines a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuration with a powerful C++ backend for real-time audio processing and light control.

## Features

### **Graphical User Interface**
- **Easy Configuration:** Use the GUI to configure light settings, including IP addresses, effects, and colors.
- **Device Selection:** Allows manual or dropdown selection of audio input devices.
- **Advanced Settings:** Fine-tune advanced options like sample rates, frame sizes, brightness thresholds, and more.
- **Reset to Defaults:** Restore default settings with a single click.

### **Audio Visualizer**
- **Real-Time Frequency Mapping:** Maps audio frequencies to light colors in real-time.
- **Dynamic Brightness Control:** Adjusts brightness based on audio energy levels.
- **Customizable Colors:** Supports user-defined color palettes for frequency changes.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Enables or disables smooth color transitions for effects.
- **Beat Detection:** Triggers light changes based on dynamic thresholds.

### **Installation**
- **Installer Included:** A single installer sets up the GUI and the backend C++ program, ready to run.
- **Configurable Paths:** Simplifies deployment with easy-to-edit configuration files.

### **Light Effects**
- **Color Changes:** Dynamically change light colors based on audio frequency.
- **Brightness Adjustment:** Automatically adjust light brightness according to energy levels.
- **On/Off Switching:** Trigger lights to turn on or off in response to beats or silence.

### **Calibration**
- **Silence Threshold Calibration:** Automatically adjusts the silence threshold to account for varying noise levels.
- **Dynamic Gain Control:** Ensures consistent light response across different audio volumes.

### **Customization**
- **Configurable JSON Files:** Allows advanced users to directly modify `config.json` for granular control.
- **Flexible Effects:** Choose between color changes, brightness adjustments, or turning lights on/off.

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.
- **Dependencies**: Installed with the program:
  - PortAudio
  - FFTW3
  - Boost Asio
- **WiZ Lights**: Requires WiZ smart lights connected to the same network.

## Configuration File
The program uses `config.json` for storing settings. Key options include:
- `audio_device`: Name of the audio input device.
- `advanced_settings`: Contains options like `SAMPLE_RATE`, `FRAMES_PER_BUFFER`, and more.
- `lights`: Define each lightâ€™s IP, effect, and color settings.

## Known Issues
- Duplicate entries may appear in the light list if names are renamed and refreshed.
- White color display inconsistencies in some scenarios.
- Lights not on the network will not respond but are displayed in the preview.
